## 📖 描述

When the target of demon dream is a worshiper of a demon lord or Lamashtu, the caster has the option of making the spell function instead as a @Compendium[pf1.spells.ifcnx1yyw6e7ousm]{Dream} spell. Otherwise, this spell functions like @Compendium[pf1.spells.siv3ub7hbmcklf8c]{Nightmare} (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 316), save that the subject matter of the dream always involves demons. Upon waking from a demon dream, the victim must make a saving throw against the spell to resist taking 1d6 points of Wisdom drain from the unsettling, madness- inducing dream&mdash;this is in addition to the damage and fatigue normally caused by the nightmare.
