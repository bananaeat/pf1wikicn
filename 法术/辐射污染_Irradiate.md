    ## 📖 描述

    The spell's area of effect floods with dangerous radiation. The strength of the radiation you create depends on your caster level, as detailed below. The central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius spread that expands normally per the rules for radiation areas of effect (see page 55). Creatures within the area are exposed to the radiation only once; the radiation does not linger in the area. The save to resist the radiation effects is set by the spell, not the standard save DC for radiation.

    Caster Level Radiation Level 6th or lower Low 7th-9th Medium 10th-16th High 17th or higher Severe
