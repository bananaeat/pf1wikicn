    ## 📖 描述

    You focus emotional energy and weave it into a shroud of hardened ectoplasm around the weapon you touch, infusing it with a ghostly glow and great power. The weapon becomes a ghost touch weapon, and gains one of the following additional benefits, depending on the type of emotion you  infuse into the weapon. If a special ability wouldn't apply to the chosen weapon (such as vicious on a ranged weapon), the weapon doesn't gain that benefit.  Anger: The weapon also gains the vicious special ability.  Dedication: The weapon also gains the returning special ability.  Despair: The weapon also gains the cruelUE special ability.  Fear: The weapon also gains the menacingUE special ability.  Hatred: The weapon also gains the cunningUE special ability.  Jealousy: The weapon also gains the mimeticUE special ability.  Zeal: The weapon also gains the keen special ability.  If you are a spiritualist and the type of emotional energy you choose matches the emotional focus of your phantom, the weapon grants its wielder a +2 bonus on skill checks with both skills you gain Skill Focus in from your phantom's emotional focus.
