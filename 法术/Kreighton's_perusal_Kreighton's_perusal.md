## 📖 描述

You gain a brief but incomplete understanding of one book's contents, equivalent to having skimmed its pages for 1 hour. This insight is not sufficient to translate unknown languages, decipher codes, or memorize text, but it does allow the caster to learn what topics the book discusses- invaluable to a Pathfinder who must make a snap decision when performing research or deciding whether or not to abscond with a volume. In addition, you instantly benefit from any bonuses or effects the book would normally grant to anyone who reads it for 1 hour (such as the bonuses gained from reading volumes of the Pathfinder Chronicles; see pages 26-27).
