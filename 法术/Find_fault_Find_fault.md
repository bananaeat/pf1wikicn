## 📖 描述

You instantly learn many of the target's weaknesses, as if you had made an appropriate Knowledge skill check with a result equal to 20 + your caster level. Additionally, your first melee or ranged attack roll against the creature before the end of your next turn gains a +5 insight bonus. If the creature is polymorphed, disguised, or hidden by an illusion and you are not aware of it's true form, this spell fails as if the target has spell resistance you failed to penetrate (the GM may have you attempt a caster level check to conceal the true reason for the spell's failure).
