    ## 📖 描述

    This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.cnn3hvm9e4bub6pr]{discharge}, except it can discharge multiple technological objects and can be used to target an area.

    You choose to use greater discharge in one of two ways: an area discharge or a targeted discharge.

    Area Discharge: When greater discharge is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst.

    Each creature in the area is affected as though by discharge (affecting only one object in the creature's possession), and each unattended object is similarly affected.

    Targeted Discharge: This spell functions as discharge, but if the target is a creature, it can discharge one randomly determined object from the target's charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you possess.
