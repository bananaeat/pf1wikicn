## 📖 描述

This spell functions as per Form of the Alien Dragon I, except it also allows you to assume the form of a Large esoteric or outer dragon. Psychics can choose from the esoteric dragon (astral, dream, etheric, nightmare, or occult) forms only. You gain the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to your Strength, a +4 size bonus to your Constitution, a +6 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 90 feet (poor), darkvision with a range of 60 feet, a breath weapon, damage reduction 5/magic, and resistance to one form of energy or effect. You also gain one bite attack (2d6), two claw attacks (1d8), a tail slap attack (1d8), and two wing attacks (1d6). All breath weapons deal 6d8 points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to halve the normal damage. Line breath weapons increase to 80-foot lines and cones increase to 40-foot cones.
