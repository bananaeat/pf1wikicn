    ## 📖 描述

    You conjure a Large, quasi-real creature made of flame. It functions like @Compendium[pf1.spells.zpwd0f19q1lm04p3]{Phantom Steed}, except as follows.

    The flame steed is immune to fire and has acid, cold, and electricity resistance 10. If it or its rider is attacked, it automatically exhales a 15-foot cone of smoke and ash on your turn as a free action. Anyone in the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC equal to the spell DC) or become sickened for 1d6 rounds after leaving the area. This smoke acts as @Compendium[pf1.spells.tuh5vc2bojaws3ig]{Obscuring Mist} for the purpose of concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round.
