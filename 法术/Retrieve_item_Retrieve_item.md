## 📖 描述

You call a specific nonliving item directly to your hand from a nearby location. First, you must cast the spell on the item while holding it. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and snapping your fingers. The item appears instantly in your hand.

If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell fails.
