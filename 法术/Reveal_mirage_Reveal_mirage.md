    ## 📖 描述

    You can focus upon a single point within line of sight and discern if the terrain or geographic features of that point are illusory. This ability allows you a Will save to disbelieve a terrain-affecting illusion (glamer) effect from range as though you had interacted with it. In addition to affecting such spells as hallucinatory terrain and mirage arcana, this spell also allows you to disbelieve naturally occurring mirages.
