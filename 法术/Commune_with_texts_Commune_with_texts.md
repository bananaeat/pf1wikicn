    ## 📖 描述

    You quickly absorb the knowledge in the target, which can be any assortment of books, scrolls, or other texts. During the spell's duration, you can search the texts and immediately find the most relevant information regarding any topic the collection holds, potentially including singling out spellbooks or scrolls containing individual or particular types of spells. You can attempt Knowledge checks related to the collection's topics as if you were trained in those skills, and you know whether the collection contains any information about which you failed a Knowledge check in the past 24 hours. The bonus on Knowledge checks granted by the collection of texts (if any) increases by 2.  Additionally, you always deplete the maximum number of knowledge points from a library whenever you succeed at a Research check (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 148) using the target texts while this spell is in effect, even if completing the Research check takes longer than this spell lasts. Once during the duration of this spell, for a number of minutes equal to your caster level, you can also speak with the texts about anyone who has read or handled them previously, as per stone tell.
