    ## 📖 描述

    All affected creatures are veiled with a commonplace appearance. This appearance varies based on the viewer, but is always an ordinary member of that viewer's race, ethnicity, or nationality. This familiarity grants a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks attempted by affected targets against those not affected by the spell.  Creatures with an attitude of unfriendly or hostile toward an affected target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect the first time they encounter that target.
