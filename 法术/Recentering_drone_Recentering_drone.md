## 📖 描述

You emit a calming subsonic drone that allows the targets to temporarily refocus and restore their balance when they're suffering from debilitating conditions. A target with the dazzled, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition ignores the penalties of those conditions for the duration of this spell. A target with one of the following conditions is treated as having the associated lesser condition for the duration of the spell, as shown by the following table.

   ConditionLesser ConditionBlindedDazzledExhaustedFatiguedFrightenedShakenNauseatedSickened    At the end of the spell's duration, the targets are again subject to the appropriate penalties if the original conditions affecting the target are still in effect.
