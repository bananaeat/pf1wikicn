## 📖 描述

This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of a Symbol of Distraction instead become fascinated by the symbol for 10 minutes per caster level. Unlike symbol of death, Symbol of Distraction has no hit point limit; once triggered, a Symbol of Distraction simply remains active for a duration of 10 minutes x your caster level. All fascinated creatures move toward the Symbol of Distraction, trying to remain within the symbol's area of effect. If the symbol leads affected creatures into a dangerous area, each fascinated creature can attempt an additional Will saving throw, with success indicating it is no longer fascinated. If a creature's view of the symbol is completely blocked, it is immediately freed of the symbol's effect.
