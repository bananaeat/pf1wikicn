    ## 📖 描述

    You tap into the awareness and consciousness of a plane with a sentient structure (Planar Adventures 60), allowing it to answer questions. A tangible manifestation of the plane (such as the ground) must be within the spell's range upon casting.  You can ask the sentient plane one question per 2 caster levels. If the plane's alignment is at least one step away from yours, the plane can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. A plane typically has a +20 bonus on Will saves, and a demiplane typically has a +15 bonus on Will saves. A plane's traits can further affect these bonuses: a mildly aligned plane receives a +2 bonus, and a strongly aligned plane or a plane with the wild magic trait receives a +4 bonus on its save.  If a plane has been subject to this spell within the past week, a new casting of this spell targeting the same plane fails. If Speak with Plane targets a plane that does not have a sentient structure, the spell fails.
