    ## 📖 描述

    This spell creates a rip in reality that plunges into the interspatial vortices that constantly churn with the raw destructive chaos of the Abyss. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the Maw of Chaos attempts a drag combat maneuver check against every creature within 40 feet, using your caster level plus your primary spellcasting ability modifier in place of a CMB. If a creature is dragged into a Maw of Chaos, the area erupts in a surge of chaotic energy and the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level. Only one such eruption can occur per round.  Creatures dragged adjacent to the Maw of Chaos become entangled by the frayed strands of reality being torn apart at the rim of the Maw of Chaos. Escape requires a successful Escape Artist check or grapple check against a DC equal to 10 plus the spell's save DC. Every creature without the chaotic subtype that ends its turn adjacent to a Maw of Chaos takes 2 points of damage to each ability score. Creatures with the lawful subtype take double this amount of damage; creatures with the chaotic subtype take no damage.  Calling, summoning, and teleportation effects used within 30 feet of the Maw of Chaos or that cause a creature to appear within 30 feet of a Maw of Chaos are redirected, causing the creature to arrive adjacent to the Maw of Chaos rather than at its intended destination. Unattended objects (including dead bodies) adjacent to the Maw of Chaos are drawn into it and affected as by disintegrate at the beginning of the caster's next turn.
