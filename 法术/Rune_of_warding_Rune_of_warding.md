## 📖 描述

You inscribe a series of runes upon the surface of a door or around the border of an entryway. They function as a Glyph of Warding (blast glyph), though unlike a Glyph of Warding, these runes are always visible. The runes count as a Glyph of Warding for the purpose of what spells can defeat it, placing multiple glyphs in the same area, and so on.
