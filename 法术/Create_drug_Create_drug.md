## 📖 描述

The caster conjures into being one of the following drugs: aether, flayleaf, opium, pesh, scour, shiver, or zerk. (At the GM's discretion, other drugs of similar power can be included on this list.) The drug doses the caster creates with this spell must be used within 1 minute of being conjured, or they dissolve into worthless dust or evaporate into noxious but fleeting vapors, though the effects of the drug may last far longer if taken before it decays.  The drugs created by this spell cannot be sold, but they can be given to other creatures. A creature that takes a dose of one of these drug typically must be either willing or helpless, though some drugs might be inhaled, applied to injuries, or secretly slipped into food if the caster acts swiftly (see each drug's description). The DC to resist a drug created by this spell is based on the conjurer's caster level, not the DC listed in the common versions of the drug. For more information, see Drugs and Addiction on page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide.  As a special use of this spell, a lawful evil worshiper of Mahathallah, the Dowager of Illusions, can create doses of the drug adyton (see the sidebar above). A Mahathallah worshiper can create adyton only once per week, regardless of her level or how many times she casts this spell. The spell otherwise functions- and creates as many doses-as normal.
