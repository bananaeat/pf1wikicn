## 📖 描述

You gain a +5 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks to convince a listener that they will get in trouble with their superiors or with the law if they don't do what you ask.

This spell is primarily used by the Eagle Knights, though they did not create it; Hellknights also use it extensively to gather information and foster cooperation.
