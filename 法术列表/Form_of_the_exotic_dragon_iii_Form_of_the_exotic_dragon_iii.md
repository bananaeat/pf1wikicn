## 📖 描述

This spell functions as per Form of the Exotic Dragon II except that it also allows you to take the form of a Huge imperial or primal dragon. Druids can choose from the primal dragon (brine, cloud, crystal, magma, or umbral) forms only. You gain the following abilities: a +10 size bonus to your Strength, a +8 size bonus to your Constitution, a +8 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 120 feet (poor), blindsense with a range of 60 feet, darkvision with a range of 120 feet, a breath weapon, damage reduction 10/ magic, frightful presence (DC = DC for this spell), and immunity to one form of energy (of the same type Form of the Exotic Dragon I grants a resistance to, if any). You gain one bite attack (2d8), two claw attacks (2d6), a one tail slap attack (2d6), and either a gore attack (2d8) if you assume the form of an imperial dragon or two wing attacks (1d8) if you assume the form of a primal dragon. You can use the breath weapon as often as you like, but must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 12d8 points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to halve the normal damage. Line breath weapons increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase to 50-foot cones.
