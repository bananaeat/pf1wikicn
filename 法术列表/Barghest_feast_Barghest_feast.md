## 📖 描述

The target gains the ability to absorb power from devouring a humanoid corpse. To use this ability, the target must feed on the corpse of one nonevil humanoid creature, a process that takes 1 full round per Hit Die the creature had and provokes attacks of opportunity. For every 2 rounds it feeds on the corpse in this way, the target gains a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks (to a maximum of +5).
