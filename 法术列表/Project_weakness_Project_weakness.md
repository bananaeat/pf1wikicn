## 📖 描述

You curse the target with the weaknesses of your kind of vampirism. The creature reacts to garlic, mirrors, ringing bells, sunlight, and so on as if it were a vampire of the same type as you. This cannot kill the target; anything that would kill it (such as a lengthy exposure to sunlight if you are a moroi vampire) renders it helpless until the curse or the harmful effect is removed. The target gains none of the benefits of being a vampire (such as fast healing or requiring special ways to be permanently killed), only the penalties.
