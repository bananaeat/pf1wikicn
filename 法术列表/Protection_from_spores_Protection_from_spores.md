## 📖 描述

With a touch, you bolster a creature's body to protect it from the harmful effects of spores and similar afflictions. While under the effect of this spell, a creature is immune to the effects of brown mold, green slime, russet mold, yellow mold, and any similar hazard, provided the hazard is CR 6 or lower. Similarly, the creature is immune to poison, disease, and infestation attacks from all fungal creatures of CR 6 or lower, including  effects such as basidirond spores, violet fungus rot, and the like. The target is immune to fungus-based toxins, such as striped toadstool. Against similar hazards or monsters of CR 7 or higher, the target gains a bonus on all saving throws against the effect equal to half your caster level. Protection from Spores offers no protection against fungal infestations created by the seeded, by the spell what grows within, or by Xhamen-Dor.
