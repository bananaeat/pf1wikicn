## 📖 描述

This spell causes a wave of positive energy to spread from a point you designate, damaging foes vulnerable to positive energy and bolstering living creatures. Each creature damaged by positive energy in the area (such as undead) must succeed at a Will save or take 1d6 points of damage, plus 1 point for every 2 caster levels (maximum +5). Haunts manifesting in the spell's area also take this damage.  This spell does not heal creatures healed by positive energy; such creatures instead gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, negative energy, and effects directly caused by haunts. This bonus lasts for 1 round.
