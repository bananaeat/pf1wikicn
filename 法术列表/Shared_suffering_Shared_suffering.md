## 📖 描述

You infuse a dagger with necromantic energy, then plunge the dagger into your own body. You take 1d6 points of negative energy damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every 2 caster levels you possess beyond 1st (to a maximum of 5d6 at 9th level). The target takes an amount of damage equal to the damage you took this way, plus an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier (if you're a witch or wizard), Wisdom modifier (if you're an inquisitor), or Charisma modifier (if you're an antipaladin or sorcerer).  Damage from this spell cannot be divided by effects such as shield other or unwilling shieldAPG; it cuts through such protections completely.
