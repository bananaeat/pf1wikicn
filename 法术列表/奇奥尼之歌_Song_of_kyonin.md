## 📖 描述

Certain elven bards of Kyonin are known for the restorative power of their performances-mostly as a result of this spell. You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell (although this spell is called song of Kyonin, the bardic performance need not be singing). As long as that performance continues, up to 3 creatures affected by the performance gain fast healing 2. When this bardic performance ends or you change to a different bardic performance, the fast healing granted by this spell ends as well, but all creatures affected by this spell heal 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) and are cured of any of the following conditions: exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, paralyzed, sickened, or stunned.
