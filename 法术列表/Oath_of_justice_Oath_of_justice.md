## 📖 描述

This spell seals a solemn vow between two creatures. When this spell is cast, the targets must clasp hands and swear their oath in Kols's name. The spell functions like mark of justice, except as noted above and rather than being cursed, the oath-breaker gains a mark on the face indicating to all dwarves who see it that the target has broken a sacred oath, which gives the oath-breaker a -4 penalty to influence dwarves. The mark can be removed as described in the mark of justicespell, or the other target can forgive the oath- breaker, which causes the mark to vanish.
