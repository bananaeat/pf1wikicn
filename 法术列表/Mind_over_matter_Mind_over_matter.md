You blur the lines between mind and body, reassigning ability damage or drain your target has taken to a corresponding ability score, as per the following table.   Physical Ability ScoreMental Ability ScoreStrengthIntelligenceDexterityWisdomConstitutionCharisma     The transfer of damage can go either way-you can convert Intelligence damage to Strength damage and vice versa. You can transfer any number of points of damage or drain in a single casting, though only from one ability score to the corresponding ability score. You cannot transfer enough ability damage or drain to reduce an ability score to 0.
