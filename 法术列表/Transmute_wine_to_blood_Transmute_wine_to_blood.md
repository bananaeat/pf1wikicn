## 📖 描述

You transform one bottle of fine wine into 1 pint of animal blood, sufficient for a creature with the blood drain ability to feed upon as if it came from a Medium animal with 1 Hit Die. If you are using the optional hunger rules (see page 22), this blood satiates an undead creature's hunger, negating any withdrawal effects, but does not grant the creature a feeding bonus. The blood coagulates and spoils at the normal rate.
