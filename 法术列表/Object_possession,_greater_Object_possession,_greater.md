## 📖 描述

This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.9pn76tz05b9g0peq]{Object Possession}, except as noted above. The possessed animated object has a number of Construction Points appropriate for its size (up to 5 CP for Gargantuan objects). Your silver cord extends to medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level). You can attempt to possess a construct instead of an unattended object as your first possession with this spell. If you do, this spell acts as @Compendium[pf1.spells.cqjtlth3uqafuwnn]{Control Construct}, except as noted above.
