## 📖 描述

This spell functions similarly to plane shift, but instead of transporting the targets to a destination near an intended location on a specific plane, Anywhere but Here transports affected creatures to a random plane. A creature can be affected by Anywhere but Here only if it is currently not on its home plane (although targets can, by chance, end up traveling to their home plane as a result of this spell). Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but the exact destination is otherwise random. The specific plane is determined by the table below; the location on the destination plane where the transported creatures arrive is completely subject to the GM's whim.     d%Planar Destination1-7Abyss8-14Abaddon15-20Hell21-24Shadow Plane25-28First World29-35Maelstrom36-42Boneyard43-49Axis50-56Ethereal Plane57-63Elysium64-70Nirvana71-77Heaven78-84Astral Plane85-90Random demiplane91-95Material Plane (random world)96-100GM's choice   A creature that is transported by Anywhere but Here cannot be affected by a subsequent casting of Anywhere but Here for 24 hours afterward (but can be affected normally by other forms of planar travel).
