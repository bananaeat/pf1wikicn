## 📖 描述

You create an alchemical residue on your hands that allows you to reshape any nonmagical, unattended object with  hardness 19 or less as though it were clay. Objects with hardness 9 or less are like soft clay, allowing you to reshape up to 1 cubic foot per round of effort. Objects with hardness 10 or higher are harder to mold, allowing you to reshape up to 1/4 cubic foot per round. The object retains its new shape for 24 hours before returning to its original shape. This spell does not allow you to reshape a portion of a large object, such as a wall; you must be able to reshape the entire target within the spell's duration or the spell fizzles and has no effect.
