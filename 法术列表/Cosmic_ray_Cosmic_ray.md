## 📖 描述

You fling a ray of deadly cosmic energy at the target creature. If you succeed at a ranged touch attack with the ray, the target takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and must make a Fortitude save. On a failed save, the target becomes sickened for 1 round per caster level and emits toxic cosmic energy for as long as it is sickened; any creature that comes within 5 feet of the affected target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = spell's DC) or become sickened for 1 round per 2 caster levels.
