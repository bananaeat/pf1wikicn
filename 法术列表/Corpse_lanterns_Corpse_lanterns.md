## 📖 描述

This spell functions as dancing lights, except it summons up to four spheres of light, each of which glows a sickly pale green. These corpse lanterns shed dim light in a 20-foot radius, and do not increase the light level in areas of normal light or bright light. In dim or normal light, the radiance of corpse lanterns provides a strange contrast, giving all creatures in the area a -5 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, the hue interferes with illusion (pattern) spells, giving all creatures in the illuminated area a +2 bonus on any saving throws against such spells. Unlike dancing lights, you may have more than one corpse lanterns spell active at a time, but you may only move one set in any given round.

Moving the corpse lanterns does not require concentration.

Corpse lanterns can be made permanent on an area with a permanency spell by a caster of at least 11th level for the cost of 7,500 gp.
