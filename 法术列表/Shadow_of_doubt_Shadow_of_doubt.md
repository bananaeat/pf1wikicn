## 📖 描述

You create a shadowy aura of doubt fueled by a foe's own inner flaws. Targets perceive all illumination as if it were one light level darker, to a minimum light level of darkness (not supernatural darkness), even on a successful saving throw.  Fleeting mental shadows of regrets and anxieties distract the spell's targets; at the start of each of their turns, they must each succeed at a Will save or be staggered for 1 round. A good-aligned target takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect; an evil-aligned target gains a +4 bonus instead.
