## 📖 描述

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma. All creatures with fewer than 8 HD are compelled to stop and pay attention to you. Any such creature that wants to take hostile action against you must make a Will save to do so. Any creature that fails this saving throw the first time it attempts a hostile action is enthralled for the duration of the spell (as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.v3d3lnjj7ks0ztii]{Enthrall} spell), as long as it is in the spell&rsquo;s area. It does not try to leave the area on its own. Creatures with 8 HD or more are not affected.

When you speak, all listeners telepathically understand you. You can make up to three suggestions to creatures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as if using the @Compendium[pf1.spells.52v3fogun1n9jzum]{Mass Suggestion} spell (Will save negates). Only creatures within range at the time of a suggestion are subject to it.
