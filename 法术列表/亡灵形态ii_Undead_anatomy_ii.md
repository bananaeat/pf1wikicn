## 📖 描述

This spell functions as undead anatomy I, except it also allows you to assume the form of a Tiny or Large corporeal creature of the undead type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet (good maneuverability), swim 60 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, blood drain, DR 5/bludgeoning, scent, freeze, grab, mimicry, pounce, shadowless, sound mimicry, and trip.

In this form, you gain a +4 bonus on saves against mindaffecting effects, disease, poison, sleep, and stunning. If the form has a vulnerability to an attack (such as sunlight), you gain that vulnerability.

Tiny undead: If the form you take is that of a Tiny undead, you gain a +4 size bonus to your Dexterity, a -2 penalty to your Strength, and a +1 natural armor bonus.

Large undead: If the form you take is that of a Large undead, you gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a -2 penalty to your Dexterity, and a +4 natural armor bonus.
