# 高等凶猛野兽 (Ferocious Beast, Greater, Ex)

**先决条件** [野蛮人](/野蛮人)8级，[凶猛野兽](/狂暴之力/凶猛野兽)

**益处：** 当野蛮人狂暴时，动物伙伴会获得野蛮人狂暴之力中常态存在的好处。它不会获得需要动作启动的狂暴之力的好处，哪怕是自由动作也一样。

Benefit: While the barbarian is raging, her animal companion shares the benefits of the barbarian’s rage powers that are constant in effect. It gains no benefit from rage powers that require actions to activate, even if they are free actions.
