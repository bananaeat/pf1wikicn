# 唬骗
你对如何说谎颇有心得。

**检定：** 唬骗检定将用来对抗目标的察言观色检定。

### 表：唬骗检定调整值
| 状况                             | 唬骗检定调整                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 目标愿意相信你                    | +5                              |
| 谎言可信                          | +0                              |
| 谎言不太可靠                      | -5                              |
| 谎言过于牵强                      | -10                             |
| 谎言不可能发生                    | -20                             |
| 目标醉酒或者头脑不灵光            | +5                              |
| 你出示可以支持谎言的证据          | 最多+10                         |

## 密语
通过使用唬骗技能，你可以用暗号伪装一段信息，将之传递给另一个角色而不被其他人了解到信息的内容。传递一段简单信息的唬骗检定DC是15，更复杂一些的则为20。如果你的检定成功，目标将自动理解你所发出的信息 (前提是他能听懂你的语言)。不过如果你检定失败并低于DC至少5点，你会传递一段错误的信息。收到信息的生物可以通过察言观色检定对抗你的唬骗检定，如果胜出才可以理解信息的内容。

**动作：** 运用唬骗技能传递信息需要正常传递的两倍时间。

**重试：** 可。如果第一次失败，可以再次尝试传递密语。

## 欺骗或撒谎
如果你试图对某个目标进行唬骗，那么成功的检定代表目标相信你说的一切都是实话。唬骗检定的修正取决于你谎言的可信程度，根据唬骗使用者的投骰结果加上下表所示的检定修正。不过注意，有一些过于荒谬的谎言是绝对不可能说动听者的 (具体情况由GM裁定)。

**重试：** 如果你在对一个目标说谎的唬骗检定中失败，你可以重试，不过在下一次检定中承受-10减值 (具体情况由GM判断)。

## 假装无害
It’s often useful to attempt to convince your enemies you are no threat to them.

Check: You attempt to convince your target you are harmless through your actions and posture. If you are at least one size category smaller than your target and have taken no effective offensive actions that your target has seen, you gain a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. Even if you have proven yourself capable of dealing damage, an effort to present your previous success as a one-time fluke takes only a –10 penalty on the check.

Action: Taking steps to appear harmless requires a full-round action, though a GM may require more involved Bluff attempts to take longer.

Retry? You can attempt to feign harmlessness to the same target again, but each previous failed check increases the DC to convince your target by 5. This increase resets after 1 hour has passed.

## 虚招
你可以在战斗中利用唬骗技能向对手发动佯攻，使得目标对抗你的下一次攻击时AC失去敏捷加值。虚招的唬骗检定DC等于 {10+目标BAB+感知修正}；如果你对一个在察言观色技能上受训的目标使用虚招，这个DC可以改为 {10+目标察言观色检定加值}，两者取其高。关于更多在战斗中使用虚招的信息，详见规则部分的战斗章节。

**动作：** 在战斗中使用虚招需要一个标准动作。

**重试：** 可。如果虚招尝试失败，你可以重试。

## Perform Inconspicuous Action
You can avoid drawing attention to yourself when performing conspicuous actions such as picking up an object in a museum where handling the exhibits is frowned upon but not a matter of grave concern, or closely studying someone across a room at a party.

Action: You attempt the Bluff check as part of performing the action you wish to render inconspicuous. Normally, you must take twice as long as normal to perform the action in order to make it inconspicuous. A standard action becomes a full-round action completed just before the start of your next turn and a free, immediate, move, or swift action becomes a standard action.

Check: Your Bluff check is opposed by observers’ Sense Motive checks. You can’t attempt the check if your very presence is suspicious (which you could prevent by altering your appearance with the Disguise skill).

## Suggest Course of Action
You can use Bluff and Diplomacy together to make a request of a creature, without it even realizing you have made the request.

Check: You can gradually coax a target into thinking a suggestion is entirely its own idea, making the creature more likely to act on the idea than if you had suggested it outright. You discuss topics subtly relevant to the request, asking leading questions and narrowing the scope of the conversation so that the target eventually decides to take a specific action you have led it to.

You first attempt a Bluff check to convince the target that your request was actually its idea. This is always treated as far-fetched circumstances, resulting in a –10 penalty on the check. If successful, you then attempt a Diplomacy check to make the request of the creature, treating its attitude toward you as indifferent for this single request (regardless of its actual attitude).

Action: Planting the notion and then coaxing a target into suggesting the notion himself each require at least 1 minute of continuous interaction. This can be difficult to arrange with a hostile or unfriendly creature.
