# 职业概述 (Classes Overview)
一名角色的职业，是他最为重要的风貌特征之一。职业是他绝大多数能力的来源，并使他在任何冒险团队中都能占据某一特定席位。

## 角色升级 (Character Advancement)
当玩家角色克服挑战时，他们就会获得经验值。经验值积累可使玩家角色升级，获得更强大的力量。

## 核心职业 (Core Classes)

## 基础职业 (Base Classes)

虽然村民们可能同一位战士举杯共饮、或目睹一位法师展现神奇魔法，他们并不是传说或历史中唯一耳熟能详的冒险者。基础职业为玩家们展示了新选项，也向GM提供了更多样的NPC设置。扩展基础职业与核心规则中的11项核心基础职业地位相等。GM可以允许玩家自由地选择这些职业、以及相伴而来的额外规则，不过每位GM都需要参考世界观中不同职业的普及程度，来决定自己的战役里应该允许和禁止哪些元素。

| 职业               | 职业描述                                              |

## 混合职业 (Hybrid Classes)
Most heroes progress along a single path—choosing to become a fearsome fighter, pious cleric, or mighty wizard—but some are drawn to many roads. For them, it can be hard to find a balance between abilities offered by disparate classes. Hybrid classes solve this dilemma by blending features from two classes, adding rules to make them work seamlessly together.

**Parent Classes:** Each one of the following classes lists two classes that it draws upon to form the basis of its theme. While a character can multiclass with these parent classes, this usually results in redundant abilities. Such abilities don’t stack unless specified. If a class feature allows the character to make a one-time choice (such as a bloodline), that choice must match similar choices made by the parent classes and vice-versa (such as selecting the same bloodline). The new classes presented here are all hybrids of two existing core or base classes.

| 职业               | 职业描述                                              |
| --- | --- |
| 奥能师 (Arcanist) | A melding of sorcerer and wizard, the arcanist is an arcane tinkerer and spell-twister, reshaping magic to her whims. Players who like options and variety in their spellcasting should consider this class. |
| 血脉狂怒者 (Bloodrager)    | Blending the wrath of the barbarian with the innate magic of the sorcerer, the bloodrager taps into his rage to create brutal magical effects. Players who enjoy eldritch savagery and want their magic to support them in combat should consider this class. |
| 拳师 (Brawler)      | Unifying two of the game’s greatest pugilists, the fighter and the monk, the brawler forgoes mysticism and spiritual training to focus on raw physical mastery. Players who want to take on their opponents in fierce hand-to-hand combat should consider this class. |
| 猎人 (Hunter)    | Combining the natural skills and animal mastery of the druid and the ranger, the hunter teams up with a devoted animal ally to confront the enemies of the wilds. Players who want an animal companion to be their character’s focus should consider this class. |
| 调查员 (Investigator)     | Mixing the alchemist’s arcane insight with the shrewdness of a rogue, the investigator uses his knowledge and a wide range of talents to overcome any conundrum. Players who enjoy clever characters who are always prepared should consider this class. |
| 萨满 (Shaman)        | The occult mysteries of the oracle and witch combine in the shaman, an enigmatic spirit-speaker who calls upon powers from beyond. Players who seek new routes to eerie divine powers should consider this class. |
| 歌者 (Skald)  | The skald blends the passion and relentlessness of the barbarian with the voice of the bard, inspiring his fellows from the front lines. Players who want to both join their allies in battle and bolster their might should consider this class. |
| 杀手 (Slayer)      | Deft stalkers of the most dangerous prey, slayers merge the ranger’s combat training with the rogue’s crippling attacks. Players who seek to deal death from the shadows should consider this class. |
| 游荡剑客 (Swashbuckler	)      | Bringing together the martial mastery of the fighter and the style of the gunslinger, the swashbuckler uses fast weapons and bewildering melee skills to lay her opponents low. Players who enjoy quick, daring combatants should consider this class. |
| 战争祭祀 (Warpriest)      | Adding a fighter’s physical might to the force of a cleric’s convictions, the warpriest strikes against enemies of his faith. Players who want to play a battle-hardened divine champion should consider this class. |

## 掉链职业 (Unchained Classes)

Your choice of class remains one of the most important parts of creating a character. This section presents four new takes on familiar classes, which have been redesigned to improve their ease of use and power relative to other classes.

| 职业               | 职业描述                                              |
| --- | --- |
| 野蛮人 (Barbarian) | Though rage remains similar to its original design, it’s now easier to implement, and rage powers have been rebalanced to become a more important part of the class. |
| 武僧 (Monk)    | Receiving the most wide-reaching changes, the monk now has expanded options in the form of ki powers, allowing you to create exactly the monk you want to play. |
| 盗贼 (Rogue)     | The new version of the rogue gains enhancements to its combat abilities and solidifies its role as the master of skills. |
| 召唤师 (Summoner)    | The revised summoner remains largely the same, aside from a revised spell list, but players will benefit from big changes to eidolons, which now have subtypes that flavor many of your choices. |

## 异能职业 (Occult Classes)

Beyond the worship of the divine and the studies of arcane scholars lies the mysterious terrain of the mind, accessed through psychic magic. Classes that draw upon psychic magic do so via innate mental abilities, whether they directly cast spells, create elemental effects, or focus psychic energy through objects. Members of these occult classes find themselves drawn to the strange and the hidden; they have connections to the timeless Astral Plane, the haunted bleakness of the Ethereal Plane, and the history of the Material Plane chronicled as psychic impressions in places and objects.

The six classes presented below all use psychic magic. In most cases, this means they cast psychic spells.

| 职业               | 职业描述                                              |
| --- | --- |
| 操念使 (Kineticist) | With a connection to the elements, a kineticist can bring forth energy in the form of kinetic blasts. Instead of casting psychic spells, the kineticist uses unique psychic spell-like abilities called wild talents to manipulate elemental energy and matter. |
| 通灵者 (Medium)    | By contacting spirits in places of power, the medium allows the personalities of legendary heroes to overcome his own, vastly changing his abilities and spells. He holds seances to benefit himself and his allies. |
| 催眠师 (Mesmerist)     | A mesmerist’s piercing stare lets him insinuate himself into other people’s minds. A master of enchantment and illusion, the mesmerist controls and influences the behavior of others. |
| 秘学士 (Occultist)    | To make use of his powers, an occultist channels psychic energy into a varied collection of antiques and mementos with storied pasts. Every type of implement allows him to use a different school of magic. |
| 异能者 (Psychic)     | With her incredibly potent mind, the psychic can cast spells that are more powerful than those of members of any other occult class. She accesses these spells through a specific discipline, and can bend and amplify psychic spells as she casts them. |
| 唤魂师 (Spiritualist)    | Attuned to the spirits of the dead, a spiritualist forms a bond with a phantom – a returned spirit that has unfinished business but did not become undead. This spectral ally can alternate between forms, emerging from the safety of the spiritualist’s mind to take on an incorporeal form or an ectoplasmic body. |

## 替代职业 (Alternate Classes)

替代职业的基本元素与基础职业非常相近，但其对原职业做出的变化调整相对通常的变体职业而言过于巨大，因此单列为独立职业。替代职业将完全作为一项基础职业，并且在替代职业上获得过等级的角色将无法在被其替代的相关职业上升级——一名武士无法同时是骑将，以此类推。

| 职业               | 职业描述                                              |
| --- | --- |
| 反圣骑士 (Antipaladin) | 反圣骑士是圣骑士的完全对立面，视他人生命如无物，并主动地为社会带来死亡与破坏。|
| 忍者 (Ninja)    | 忍者是渗透、破坏和暗杀的大师，使用各种武器、技能和神秘能力来达成目的。 |
| 武士 (Samurai)      | 武士习得使用刀剑和弓马的技艺，将自己的一生奉献给主君。       |

## NPC职业 (NPC Classes)

Aside from the players, every other person encountered in the game world is a nonplayer character (NPC). These characters are designed and controlled by the GM to fill every role from noble king to simple baker. While some of these characters use player classes, most rely upon basic NPC classes, allowing them to be easily generated. The following rules govern all of the NPC classes and include information on generating quick NPCs for an evening’s game.

|Class|
|---|
|导师 (Adept)|
|望族 (Aristocrat)|
|平民 (Commoner)|
|专家 (Expert)|
|武者 (Warrior)|

## 进阶职业 (Prestige Classes)
Prestige classes allow characters to become truly exceptional, gaining powers beyond the ken of their peers. Unlike the core classes, characters must meet specific requirements before they can take their first level of a prestige class. If a character does not meet the requirements for a prestige class before gaining any benefits of that level, that character cannot take that prestige class. Characters that take levels in prestige classes do not gain any favored class bonuses for those levels.

## 变体职业 (Archetypes)
Base classes are a great place to start, but they can’t cover every possible character concept and specialization. Archetypes help to fill in the gaps. These are quick, plug-and-play sets of alternate class ability substitutions arranged around specific character concepts, designed to help players customize a given base class to their individual needs.
